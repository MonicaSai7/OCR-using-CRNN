# OCR-using-CRNN
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a computer vision technique which recognizes text present in any form of
images, such as scanned documents and photos. OCR is used to transform the printed text present in the scanned
images into digital form. In the recent years, OCR has improved significantly in accurate recognition of text from
images. 

The OCR system in this project is being developed using CRNN deep learning architecture which is a combination of CNN and RNN.
Initially MJSynth Synthetic word dataset is used to develop the model.
